--- Quote History ---
Write to help yourself, publish to help others.
The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease for ever to be able to do it.
If you want something then you lose everything. If you don't want anything then you already have everything.
Poetry is written with tears, fiction with blood, and history with invisible ink.
