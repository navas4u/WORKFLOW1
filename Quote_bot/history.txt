--- Quote History ---
The worst part of success is trying to find someone who is happy for you.
Do every act of your life as if it were your last.
What have you done today to make someone else happy?
It's not what you've got; it's what you do that makes the difference.
Absurdity is the ecstasy of intellectualism.
He who loses wealth loses much; he who loses a friend loses more; but he that loses his courage loses all.
